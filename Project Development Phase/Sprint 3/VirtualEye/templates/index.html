			Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle.
			Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have
			them in their house backyard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which
			causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher
			rate of mortality without causing injury to children. Children under six of their age are found to be
			suffering the highest drowning mortality rates worldwide. Such kinds of deaths account for the third
			cause of unplanned death globally, with about 1.2 million cases yearly. To overcome this conflict, a
			meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.

	<p>
	By studying body movement patterns and connecting cameras to artificial intelligence (AI) systems we can
	devise an underwater pool safety system that reduces the risk of drowning. Usually, such systems can be
	developed by installing more than 16 cameras underwater and ceiling and analyzing the video feeds to
	detect any anomalies. but AS a POC we make use of one camera that streams the video underwater and
	analyses the position of swimmers to assess the probability of drowning, if it is higher then an alert
	will be generated to attract lifeguards' attention.
