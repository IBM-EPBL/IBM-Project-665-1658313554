        <p>
            Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle.
            Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have
            them in their house backyard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which
            causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher
            rate of mortality without causing injury to children. Children under six of their age are found to be
            suffering the highest drowning mortality rates worldwide. Such kinds of deaths account for the third
            cause of unplanned death globally, with about 1.2 million cases yearly. To overcome this conflict, a
            meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.
